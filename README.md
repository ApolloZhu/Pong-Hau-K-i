TL;DR, I imported: AppKit, CoreGraphics, GameplayKit, PlaygroundSupport, and SpriteKit.

The main objective for this Playground is to explore the GamePlayKit -- state machines, AI strategies.

This is actually one of the few times I'm using AppKit.

For now, the board and pieces are rendered using SpriteKit. In the future, I could extend it to SceneKit (once I take the Computer Graphics class next year, learning about how to make 3D models) and ARKit (once I update to an iPad with AR capability).
