> In what ways have you considered sharing your coding knowledge and enthusiasm for computer science with others?



Immediately after the WWDC Scholarship info was released this year, I studied the terms and requirements carefully. I have learned a lot during the WWDC last year, therefore I want to make sure all other students I can reach out to know about this fantastic opportunity. While making a Keynote introducing the requirements and my own experience last year for the scholarship, I emailed the CS teacher at my school, begging for a chance to present to all the CS classes. Initially, he was a little reluctant since he have never heard about this before, but I didn't give up. I send more emails with long paragraphs explaining how this scholarship is different, and how students can learn and grow as computer scientists by applying to this and attending the conference. Eventually, I got 15 minutes at the start of each class. To fully utilize the time, I practiced over and over again that night, adding and removing features of Swift and Playground I should coverâ€¦. And it worthed it. You could not tell how accomplished I felt when hands raised, asking questions and saying they want to give it a try.

One could not imagine how excited I was when one girl who never had any programming experience before demonstrated a huge interest in learning Swift and start to write her first Playground. 



To ensure they can always refer to what I have mentioned, I started to write a blog post after the study session for WWDC that day. I went into more details about how to get started and learn Swift, since the most of them have never programmed for iOS/macOS before, differentiated frameworks they should use for different purposes, as well as the advantages of iPad Swift Playgrounds versus Xcode Playground. Since I shared it to the group chat we created, there have been 150 views.

And how could I ever forget about those students back in China? I had to sneak into the robotics club in my elementray school, and beg my teachers to join the programming contest study group in my middle school. How could I ever forget those days when I had to look up my English dictionary for technical terms and concepts,  which a Chinese middle schooler has no clue what they mean, that is throughout The Swift Programming Language ebook and official documentations? I know they have way more school work than we do, but still I would like them to knwo about this scholarship and give it a try. I didn't just translate the blog post from English to Chinese, but entirely rewrote it, to include information that is specific to them. That includes how they should plan to get their Visa, links to Chinese translations of the resources I mentioned, and reminding them not to download Xcode form other sources even if that's faster due to China's network conditions. Then I shared it to as many platforms as I could, requested those famous programmers to "retweet" so more students would have access to the information, and get enlisted on a weekly digital newspaper specific to iOS programming. I hope at least some of those 21,000 people who have views my Weibo, or "tweet," and of those 900 who checked out my blog told their friends and families about Swift and this scholarship, and I can't wait to see what they have accomplished.

And as the president of the CS club at Oakton High, I tried a lot of new things this year to make sure students of all levels can benefit from the club, in addition to invitng guest speakers form the field and reaching out to Rachel Carson Middle School to help out with the hour of code event. We organized the first Hackathon, and I offered a workshop about Swift Playgrounds, using technics I learned from WWDC sessions and labs last year. I lectured the club during the meetings, including how to use GitHub and contributing to open source community. And that is another thing I do in my free time, although it's very challenging to balance that with my heavy course load. I tried to spend as much time as possible to continue translating subtitles of the Stanford CS193p open course, Developing iOS Apps with Swift. And instead of recording lecture videos to publish on bilibili, one of the China's biggest video sharing platforms like Youtube, I utilized their new feature of publishing short articles instead to share tips and technics relating to Swift, so they could get up-to-date information faster.

Even I could not believe how I have written 1000 words and have to trim this down, but indeed, I'm eager to share more of my experiences and excitments with everyone else so they could do the same. None of my family members have STEM-related jobs, so I really could tell how programming could change one's life. Wish I could again attend WWDC and further continue my quest in empowering other people.
