 This traditional Chinese game, often played among the elders when they were young, is not as well know these datys. 
 It is not as well known as go, but in my hometown people always play it when they feel bored. It is often used for childhood education in some area in China and Korea too.
 Under(wear) Chess, a.k.a Pong Hau K'i (Transliteration) is one of the traditional board games in China. Why? Because the board looks like underwear.

 I/We want more people know about it.

 Even little children can understand this. It’s really easy to learn the rule, and you might think you can master it really fast, but there are actually more than you think.
 These are some of the fun facts.
  This is an ancient Chinese board game. No body
  Pong Hau K'i is an ancient Chinese tic-tac-toe-like game involving two players with two differently colored stones (say, red and blue). The players move their respective stones along a line to an adjacent empty space on a board consisting of five nodes and seven edges, illustrated above. The objective of the game is to trap the opponent so that no possible moves are available.

 How to play?    Tip1
 Each player has two pieces, and they go. You can only move your piece to the empty spot through the line. You can’t “eat” other pieces, jump over them or move to a spot where there is no line between.
 The one who can not make another step lose the game.
 
 Why did I lose?    Tip2
 Normally, in other games, the player goes first has more benefits. But in this game this player can not win unless the other player make a certain move. That means there is a offense and defense. Normally people will not notice this.
 Tips (for defense): don’t move both of your pieces to left/right side.

 Each player has two pieces. In the mobile app, they are shown in different colors. Red player will go first by default, but you can shake your device, then the Green player can go first.
 
 Player take turns to move. You can move one of your pieces at a time to the empty spot if there is a line between. You can't eat another piece, jump over them or move without a line. Notice that all the spots are connected except for the two in the bottom.
 
 How to win?
 If you can not move all your pieces, you lose the game.
 
 It is interesting that the player goes first cannot win unless the other player make some movement like the one behind this text. That means there is always a offense and defense. Both of them have some patterns they should follow, and some they should not do.
 
 Only one type of position can make a player lose. If both players play perfectly, the game continues endlessly with no winner.
  
  Board Strategy * A board game that only have four pieces, and you have a lot of fun if you play it with someone that has not play it before.
 
 
 
 3. Straffin, Philip D. published an article called "Position Graphs for Pong Hau K'i and Mu Torere". in Mathematics Magazine in 1995. This article analyzed what you should do in order to set a trap for the other user (of course you have to be the offense one).
 
 Just one more thing. I figured that out too, when I was only 10, after playing with my grandfather for a few times.

 EOL: Development of Underwear Chess: Voice
 Good Morning. My name is Apollo and I am a freshman. Thank you for coming today.
 My project is about this mobile app I made called Underwear Chess.
 Under(wear) Chess, a.k.a Pong Hau K'i (English, Transliteration) is one of the traditional board games in China. Why? Because the board looks like underwear.
 
 This is a mobile app that I made called "Underwear Chess". I know that's a funny name. That's because the shape of the board looks like underwear Underwear Chess is a traditional board game in my hometown. People used to play it to spend their spare time when they are boring. I wanted to play it with my classmates the first day I went to school, but none of them know about this game. That’s the reason why I wanted to make this app. I wanted to make them be able to carry this whenever and where ever they go. It would be ridiculous if I asked them bring a set of board and pieces.
 I started doing this at 2014. At that time, I knew nothing about programming. First, one of my teachers started teaching me Pascal, which was a really old programming language that can only make programs to solve math problems. And the programs could not run on phones. I decided to move on and learn by myself. I found a programming language called Swift, which was invented by Apple. Although it looked similar to Pascal, it was much easier for beginners like me, and even more powerful. The only problem was there were no documents I could read but the one published by Apple.  My English was not as good as yours ( because I came from China). It was really hard for me, but I looked up words in the dictionary, practiced again and again, tried as hard as I could. For the next step, I searched for video tutorials and blog articles about making iOS apps. Finally, last October, for the first time, the app started running on my iPhone. When I tried to install it on my iPad, nothing showed up. To figure it out, I asked my classmates who were good at programming for help, I joined a club called ITDC. With their help, you can try this app on your device today.
 By doing this project, I learned how to make computer programs, I practiced my problem solving skills, I also made a lot of friends with the same interests. And the most important to me, and I think what is also valuable to you, is that if you really want do something, all the challenges and difficulties are like nothing but another color on the easy trip to the success.
 Do you have any other questions? Do you want to play it?
 Thank you for coming, If possible, please introduce Underwear chess to your family members!

 Q & A
 Q: How to play?
 A: Each player has two pieces. They can only move one piece at a time, and only from the original position to THE empty spot if there is a line between the two spots. You can't "eat" other's pieces nor jump over it. It’s better to play it at a really fast pace, or it will be really boring. But anyway, it will take a lot of time to win, and you can still enjoy it anyway.
 
 ## Actually I made this app for three times.
 The first time I used Pascal programming language. It’s not really good for building a game. I had to list all the possible situations. I typed more than thousands lines of code, but I could not see the end of it.
 The second time I used the interface builder provided by Apple. It took me about two days to set it up. But for some reason it only worked on iPhone 5/5C/5S/SE. The logic part took me about three months.
 The third time was during the spring break. I programmed the user interface. I added some basic animations, supported all the screen sizes. The logic part was much smarter than what I did for the second time.
 It’s now 1020 lines of code.
 
 Just a fun fact, the direct translate of its Chinese name is "Underwear Chess." Why? Look at the board!
