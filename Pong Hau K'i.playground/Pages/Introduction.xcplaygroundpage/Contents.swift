 This traditional Chinese game, often played among the elders when they were young, is not as well know these days. Old people in my hometown taught me about this game and it's a great game to kill the time.
 The first program I've made is about this game, because I want more people to know about this cultural heritage. Hope you'll enjoy this playground.
 
 Even little children can understand this. It’s really easy to learn the rule, and you might think you can master it really fast, but there are actually more than you think.
