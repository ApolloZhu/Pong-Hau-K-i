 - Important: How to play?
 Each player has two pieces. They can only move one piece at a time, and only from the original position to THE empty spot if there is a line between the two spots. You can't "eat" other's pieces nor jump over it. Itâ€™s better to play it at a really fast pace, or it will be really boring!

/*:
 - Note: How to Win?
 If you can not move all your pieces, you lose the game. Think about how you are going to trap the opponent!
